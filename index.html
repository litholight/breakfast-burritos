    <h3>Sean's Breakfast Burritos</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use whole wheat or corn tortillas for added fiber</li>
      <li>Use lean protein sources such as turkey bacon or chicken sausage</li>
      <li>
        Incorporate a variety of vegetables, such as spinach, bell peppers, and
        onions, for added nutrients and flavor
      </li>
      <li>
        Use low-fat cheese or avocado as a topping for added creaminess without
        the extra fat
      </li>
      <li>
        Use egg whites or a low-fat dairy alternative instead of full-fat eggs
      </li>
    </ul>

      Here's a step-by-step procedure for cooking and freezing breakfast
      burritos:
    </div>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook your filling ingredients in a skillet. For example, you can saut√©
        diced vegetables, diced potatoes, and lean protein in a skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook your eggs in a separate skillet. If you're using egg whites or a
        low-fat dairy alternative, cook them as you would scrambled eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble your burritos by placing a few spoonfuls of the filling on a
        tortilla, and then adding the scrambled eggs on top. Add some cheese or
        avocado if desired.
      </li>
      <li>Roll the burrito up, tucking in the sides as you go.</li>
      <li>
        Once all the burritos are assembled, wrap them tightly in aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the wrapped burritos in a resealable plastic bag or container and
        put them in the freezer.
      </li>
      <li>
        To reheat, remove the foil and wrap the burrito in a damp paper towel.
        Heat it in the microwave for 2-3 minutes, or until heated through.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div>
      It's also worth mentioning that breakfast burritos can be reheated in the
      oven too, but that will take longer than microwaving. <br />
      You can also try freezing the ingredients separately and assemble them
      when you are ready to eat.
